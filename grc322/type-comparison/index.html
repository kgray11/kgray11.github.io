        <h1>Acumin vs. Aktiv Grotesk </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Aktiv Grotesk Typeface</h3>
             <p>The contemporary sans-serif typeface, Aktiv Grotesk, is designed by Swiss Typeface designer Bruno Maag and published by Dalton Maag in 2010. The intention behind the typeface was to design a modern, highly legible font compatible with a wide range of applications. With inspiration from classic grotesque typefaces, there are additionally subtle modern touches and incorporation of clean lines to suffice demand by contemporary design. Aktiv Grotesk features open apertures, a generous width, and a large x-height, making it exceptionally legible and accessible and suitable for both display and text use. Its large character set includes multiple styles, weights, and versatility for various design needs. </p>
             
			 <h3>Acumin Typeface</h3>

             <p>Designed by Robert Slimach, the sans-serif typeface Acumin was released by Adobe Systems in 2015. It is another contemporary grotesque typeface family that offers versatility with its range of weights and styles. All the way from thin to black to condensed to extended. It was designed to be highly legible in multiple text sizes while maintaining elegance and clarity. Slimbach’s design process involved extensive research into classic grotesque typefaces, as he aimed to create a modern interpretation that would meet contemporary design desires. Acumin features a large x-height, balanced proportions, and open apertures that contribute to its excellent readability. </p>
